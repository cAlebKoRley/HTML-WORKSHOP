    <p class>For the past weeks that i have been using the  freecodecamp responsive web design course i have been able to acquire some knowledge even
    though i haven't been able to grasp all the concepts of the responsive web development course. I started by creating a catphoto app which was the first project in the course teaching the basics of html. that was where i got to know 
    the basic elements or syntax used when coding using html. it was a bit easy at the startlearning som of the syntax and their
    significance like the !DOCTYPE html file, the head, body elements. i also was able to learn about attributes and how they are used in 
    the coding process. </p><br>
